abstract = {In this paper we apply a model of optimal bidding behavior to the Italian wholesale electricity market under three hypotheses: i) costs of generation are private knowledge, ii) firms can be vertically integrated, and iii) firms can sell part of their production in advance with bilateral contracts. We first use optimal bid functions and market data to retrieve time-varying marginal cost functions, price-cost margins and Lerner Indexes of market power for a sample of Italian companies. Then, we use estimated costs and actual equilibrium prices to evaluate the elasticity of these series to fuel price variations and estimate a possible differential impact of the dynamics of input expenditures (fuel price above all) on generation costs and final electricity prices. Our estimates suggest that the elasticities of costs and equilibrium prices with respect to oil price are virtually the same and, therefore, that the auction mechanism per se does not limit the extent to which cost increases are transferred to prices. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Holmberg2013,
abstract = {In most electricity markets generators must submit step-function offers to a uniform price auction. These markets are often modelled as simpler pure-strategy Supply Function Equilibria (SFE) with continuous supply functions. Critics argue that the discreteness and discontinuity of the required steps drastically change Nash equilibria, invalidating predictions of the SFE model. We prove that there are sufficient conditions, offered quantities can be continuously varied, offered prices are selected from a finite set, and the density of the additive demand shock is not too steep, where the resulting stepped SFE converges to the continuous SFE as the number of steps increases, reconciling the apparently very disparate approaches to modelling electricity markets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the fast growing literature that addresses the problem of the optimal bidding behaviour of power generation companies that sell energy in electricity auctions, it is always assumed that every firm knows the aggregate supply function of its competitors. Since this information is generally not available, real data have to be substituted by predictions. In this paper we propose two alternative approaches to the problem and apply them to the hourly prediction of the aggregate supply function of the competitors of the main Italian generation company.},

@article{Sun2021,
abstract = {The locational marginal price scheme, though widely adopted, fails to reflect the startup costs for many generators in the real-time market. To solve this issue, the extended locational marginal price (eLMP in short, a.k.a. convex hull price) has been proposed. The key idea is to convexify the non-convex generation cost functions due to the startup costs, and then design the uplift payment whenever necessary. While eLMP partially solves the incentive issue, there are still chances for generators to manipulate the market prices (as well as the uplift payments) by strategic bidding. In this letter, we first propose a profit decomposition method to evaluate different bidding strategies' impacts on individual payoffs. This decomposition allows us to better identify the potential strategic generators and investigate their best strategies. We further propose to use the maximal markup as an index for eLMP scheme to quantify market power in the whole system. Numerical studies further highlight the existence of market power in practice.},

abstract = {Estimating cost function of firms is very important in competitive electricity market. Complete information on the factors which can be used for estimating cost function is not definite and also is not accessible. The importance of cost function estimation is appeared when the Independent System Operator (ISO) decide to measure the market power which can be exerted by a market participant. In this paper a new method is applied for estimating cost function using observed bid information, weighted average prices and quantities in pay as bid auction in which each firm submit its prices and quantities. Wolak's cost function estimation model which is in uniform pricing auction, is applied to Iran's Electricity Market (IEM), where each genset submit its prices in ten increments which can be changed hourly, and quantities for producing in each load period. In this market, firm's cost function is recovered by optimizing behavior for each firm. After defining the profit of the firm and using the first order conditions for expected profit maximization, the generalized method of moment (GMM) is used for estimating cost function. In estimation procedure, the firm's cost function is obtained by using the weighted average prices, for computing the total revenue of each firm and the maximum accepted price, instead of market clearing price. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},
